# pseeker

Website admin panel finder improved.

## Getting Started

pseeker it's an admin panel finder script, it can be used through Tor in order to keep your IP anonymous.

## How It Works ?

It's pretty easy it loads up a list of possibile website admin control panel pages such as : 
"www.example.com/admin" , 
"www.example.com/administratorpanel" , and so on . After that it tries every combination possibile using the 'pseek_res.ps3k' list.

## Prerequisites

urllib2

colorama

psutil

stem

socks

## Usage

```python.exe .\pseeker.py```

Then follow the instructions and there you go.

## Tor Usage

To use pseeker with Tor you need to download and install [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/download) and then run it. Usually Tor runs the proxy on 127.0.0.1 on port 9150 on Windows but you can change the proxy settings inside pseeker configuration phase.
